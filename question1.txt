    Create a class DataOperation with the following attributes

        1)_dataVector which is a vector of integer values
        2)_magicNumber which is an unsigned integer
        3)A member function "findMax" that display the maximum value from the _datavector  on the concole.
        4)A member function "sumofFirstN" that takes an integer as input parameter and display the sum of first N number
        of values from _datavector
        5)A member function "FindNthValue" that takes an integer as input parameter and display 
        the value at the Nth index position of _dataVector
        6) A member fucntion "findOddNumber" that print all odd number from the_dataVector
        7)A member function "findFactorial that"
            1)Finds the factorial of number between 1 to 10 and dislpay on the out console.
            2) throws an exception for "invalid" value for all other numbers
        
        8) A member fucntion "Takeinput" that accepts input from the user and sets the value for _magicNumber.
        9) A membr fucntion "Checkprime" checks whether the _magicNumbe is a prime number or not and display a message accordinaly on 
            the console
        10)Note : checkPrime should only be exceuted after the "Takeinput" function is fully executed.Ensure appropriate mechansim for the same

    Create appropriate special member fucntion to instantitate an object of the class Dataoperation.Ensure that only 
    one object for this class can exits at any given time in the program 

     Note : 
        1) Handle all relevant exceptions
        2)Exceute all member function by using seprate thread instances.You should use an array of threads to manage 
        thread instances created
        3)Demonstrate the output of all functionalitites with appropriate client-side code.
