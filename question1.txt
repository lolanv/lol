    Create a class TransportVehcile with the following attributes
            1)_permit which is an instance of permit class(created on the heap)
            2)_vehicle_type which could be either BUS,CAB,MINI_VAN
            3)_seat_count which is an positive integer.
            4)_stops_count which is a positive integer[indicating how many stops vehicle makes between start and end points]

    Create a class Permit with the following attributes
        1)_permit_number which is a string value
        2_permit_suration_remaing which is a non-negative integer whcih is the number of month for which Permit is still valid

                    Create special member function as per requirements.
    Create the following functionalilites in functionalities.cpp file
        1)Create 4 instances of TransportVehicle on the heap (manged by a shared pointer each).Store instances
            in a fixed sized container that supports index based access.
        2)find and display the _permit_number for the instances at index position N on the console where N is passes
                    as a parameter to the function
        3)Find and print the average _seat_count for the _vehicle_type passed as the second parameter
                [Hint : If second argument is BUS,only computer average for BUS type instances]
        4)Find and print true or false indicating whether all instances have the ame _vehicle_type

    Note:
        1)Each functionality has to be executed in a spearte std::thread instances (stored and manged by using a 
                a container of std::thread instances).
        2)Handle corner cases using std::optional type.
        3)Use STL algorithms for all data processing operations.
