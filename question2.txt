create a class Engine with the following attributes.
    1)_engine_type which is either TURBOCHARGED or REGULAR
    2)_engine_hoursepower which is a float value;
    3)_engine_number which is a string value
    4) _engine_cylinder which is either 4_CYLINDER or 6_CYLINDER
    5)_engine_torque which is a float value.

// create a Operations with the following attibutes
    1)A data member called _N of type integer
    2)A data member called _data_container which is a vector of smart pointer to Engine INstances.
    3)A funtion to create object of the type Engine in a data container uing smart pointer>Every object must 
    have a unique _engine_number value.(hard code the value accorinly).
    4)A fucntion to find and return the _engine_number for the instances whose _engine_hoursepower is the maximum.
    If there are multiple instances with the same maximum,choose the instances with the first maximum.
    5)A fucntion to create an array of 2 float values corresponding to the first and last instances of the container.(If 2 
    instaces are not in the container the function should return std::nullptr)
    6)A fucntion to find and return the average _engine_torque of all instances.
    7)A function to accept a value from the user as console input and assign it to the _N parameter of the operation class
    8)A fucntion  to return _engine_type for first _N instances in the _data_container where _N is the value set
    //9) Note :
        // 1)Ensure that only one object for this class can exits at any given time in the program
        // 2)Handle all relevant exception
        // 3)Demostarte the output of all fucntionalilites with appropirate cline-side code using std::async thread instanes.
        // by the above mentioned function.
